# CodingBat Solutions

A collection of solutions to  [CodingBat](https://codingbat.com/)  practice problems in Java and Python.


## About CodingBat

CodingBat is a free website created by Nick Parlante, a computer science lecturer at Stanford University. It provides live coding problems designed to build fundamental programming skills through practice. The problems focus on core concepts like:

-   String and list manipulation
-   Loops and recursion
-   Logic and conditionals
-   Arrays and data structures

## Purpose

This repository serves as a reference for solutions to CodingBat problems. It's intended to help learners:

-   Check their work after attempting problems
-   Understand different approaches to solving coding challenges
-   Learn from alternative solutions and coding patterns

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Try the problem first**  on  [CodingBat.com](https://codingbat.com/)
2.  Work through the problem on your own
3.  Once you've solved it (or given it a good attempt), refer to solutions here
4.  Compare approaches and learn from different implementations

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have:

-   Alternative solutions
-   More efficient approaches
-   Better explanations or comments

Feel free to submit a pull request.
