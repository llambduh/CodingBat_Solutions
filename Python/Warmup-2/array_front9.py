def array_front9(nums):
    """
    Check if the number 9 appears in the first 4 elements of an array.
    
    This function examines only the first 4 elements of an integer array
    (or all elements if the array has fewer than 4) and returns True if
    at least one 9 is found, False otherwise.
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    nums : list of int
        An array (list) of integers to search. Can be empty or of any length.
        Only the first 4 elements (or fewer) will be examined.
    
    Returns:
    --------
    bool
        True if at least one 9 is found in the first 4 elements.
        False if no 9 is found or if the array is empty.
    
    Examples:
    ---------
    >>> array_front9([1, 2, 9, 3, 4])
    True
    >>> array_front9([1, 2, 3, 4, 9])
    False  # 9 is at index 4 (5th position), beyond the first 4 elements
    >>> array_front9([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    False  # No 9 in the first 4 elements
    >>> array_front9([9, 1, 2, 3])
    True  # 9 is at the first position
    >>> array_front9([1, 9])
    True  # Array has only 2 elements, 9 is found
    >>> array_front9([1, 2, 3])
    True  # Array has only 3 elements, no 9 found
    >>> array_front9([])
    False  # Empty array
    
    Implementation Notes:
    --------------------
    1. nums[:4] - Slice notation that extracts the first 4 elements
       - If the array has fewer than 4 elements, it returns all available elements
       - If the array is empty, it returns an empty list
       - Python slicing is safe and won't throw an IndexError for out-of-range indices
    
    2. .count(9) - Counts occurrences of 9 in the sliced array
    
    3. > 0 - Converts the count to a boolean:
       - If count is 1 or more, returns True
       - If count is 0, returns False
    
    Time Complexity: O(1) - Only examines up to 4 elements, constant time
    Space Complexity: O(1) - The slice creates a small list of at most 4 elements
    
    Alternative Approaches:
    ----------------------
    # Using 'in' operator (more readable):
    return 9 in nums[:4]
    
    # Using manual loop with early termination:
    for i in range(min(4, len(nums))):
        if nums[i] == 9:
            return True
    return False
    
    # Using any() with generator expression:
    return any(num == 9 for num in nums[:4])
    """
    # Slice the first 4 elements, count occurrences of 9, and return True if count > 0
    return nums[:4].count(9) > 0
