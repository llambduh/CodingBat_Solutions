def last2(str):
    # First, we need to handle edge cases where the string is too short
    # If the string has fewer than 2 characters, there's no valid substring
    # of length 2 to work with, so we return 0
    if len(str) < 2:
        return 0
    
    # Extract the last two characters of the string using negative indexing
    # str[-2:] means "start from the 2nd character from the end, go to the end"
    # Examples:
    #   - "hixxhi" → last_two = "hi"
    #   - "xaxxaxaxx" → last_two = "xx"
    #   - "axxxaaxx" → last_two = "xx"
    last_two = str[-2:]
    
    # Now we need to count how many times this substring appears in the string,
    # EXCLUDING the final occurrence (the last 2 characters themselves)
    #
    # Breaking down this line:
    # 1. range(len(str) - 2) generates indices from 0 to len(str) - 3
    #    - We subtract 2 to exclude the last 2-character substring
    #    - For "hixxhi" (length 6), this gives us indices: 0, 1, 2, 3
    #
    # 2. str[i:i+2] extracts a 2-character substring starting at position i
    #    - For "hixxhi": positions 0-1="hi", 1-2="ix", 2-3="xx", 3-4="xh"
    #
    # 3. str[i:i+2] == last_two checks if the current substring matches the last two chars
    #    - This returns True or False for each position
    #
    # 4. sum(...) adds up all the True values (True = 1, False = 0)
    #    - This gives us the total count of matches
    #
    # This is a Pythonic way of counting using a generator expression
    return sum(str[i:i+2] == last_two for i in range(len(str) - 2))
